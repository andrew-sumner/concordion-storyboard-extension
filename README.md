concordion-storyboard-extension
===============================

Often its difficult to tell from a specification exactly what is being done to the system under test.  This extension solves that dilema by capturing information (screen shots, soap xml, ...?) from the system under test and displaying them as a series of cards on a storyboard at the bottom of the specification while it is being executed.

Supports:
* browser screen shots
* text data (eg soap messages)
* catches displays exceptions 
* can group cards into collapsible sections on the storyboard 

This extension is based on the screenshot taker extension and would not be here without it.

There are some screenshots of this extension in action in the wiki.
