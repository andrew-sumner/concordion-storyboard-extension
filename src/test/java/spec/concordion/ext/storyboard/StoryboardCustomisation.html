  <h1>Customisation</h1>

  <p>The Storyboard can be customised in several different ways:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Create your own cards to capture and display different types of data by inheriting from the Card class</li>
  	<li>Create your own containers to group cards by inheriting from the Container class</li>
  	<li><code>addCardImage()</code>: Add custom card image that will be shared by all tests
  		<ul>
  			<li>Must be called before test starts otherwise this will do nothing</li>
			<li>It is possible to override stock card images if you use the same name</li>
	 	</ul>
	</li>
  	<li><code>setAddCardOnThrowable()</code>: Sets whether a card will be added to the storyboard when an uncaught exception occurs in the test
  		<ul>
  			<li>Defaults to true</li>
	 	</ul>
	</li>
  	<li><code>setAddCardOnFailure()</code>: Sets whether a card will be added to the storyboard when a failure occurs in the test
  		<ul>
  			<li>Defaults to true</li>
	 	</ul>
	</li>
  	<li><code>setScreenshotTaker(screenshotTaker, lifeCycle)</code>: Set a custom screenshot taker
  		<ul>
  			<li>By default this is not set to avoid capturing screen shots when not appropriate</li>
  			<li>The project includes <code>RobotScreenshotTaker</code>code which will capture the full visible screen<br/>
  			    As an alternative, custom screenshots can be captured using the `ScreenshotTaker` interface. For example, when using frameworks
  			    such as Selenium, a custom screenshot taker can capture an image of the entire web page, even if the test is running in the
  			    background.  See the demo application for an example of a custom <code>SeleniumScreenshotTaker</code>.</li>
			<li>The lifecycle option allows you to specify how long the screenshotTaker should be kept, options are:
				<ul>
				<li>EXAMPLE - a single example</li>
				<li>SPECIFICATION - the entire specification</li>
				</ul>
				If your specification is mixing GUI and non GUI examples then you will need to set the lifecycle to EXAMPLE to avoid adding screenshots 
				to the storyboard at inappropriate times. 
			</li>
	 	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><code>removeScreenshotTaker()</code>:Removes the screenshot taker so no further screenshots will be taken
		<ul>
  			<li>If you are mixing GUI and non GUI actions in your storyboard you may want to remove the screenshot taker to prevent further screenshots being 
  			    taken for the current example to keep the cards in a logical order.  The need for this is dependent on the setting of <code>setTakeScreenshotOnCompletion()</code></li>
	 	</ul>
	</li>
  	<li><code>setTakeScreenshotOnCompletion()</code>:  When the test completes and the ScreenshotTaker is not null the storyboard will take a screenshot of the current screen
  		<ul>
  			<li>Defaults to true</li>
	 	</ul>
	</li>
  	<li><code>setAcceptsScreenshots()</code>: Set to false to stop screenshot cards being added, this is useful in situations where might be looping and refreshing screen constantly and you don't want to show many screenshots of same screen in storyboard
  		<ul>
  			<li>Defaults to true</li>
	 	</ul>
	 </li>
	 <li><code>setTitle()</code>: set a custom title for the storyboard</li>
  </ul>
