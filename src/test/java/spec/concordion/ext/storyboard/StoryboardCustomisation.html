  <h1>Customisation</h1>

  <p>The Storyboard can be customised in several different ways:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Create your own cards to capture and display different types of data by inheriting from the Card class</li>
  	<li>Create your own containers to group cards by inheriting from the Container class</li>
  	<li><code>addCardImage()</code>: Add custom card image that will be shared by all tests
  		<ul>
  			<li>Must be called before test starts otherwise this will do nothing</li>
			<li>It is possible to override stock card images if you use the same name</li>
	 	</ul>
	</li>
  	<li><code>setAddCardOnThrowable()</code>: Sets whether a card will be added to the storyboard when an uncaught exception occurs in the test
  		<ul>
  			<li>Defaults to true</li>
	 	</ul>
	</li>
  	<li><code>setAddCardOnFailure()</code>: Sets whether a card will be added to the storyboard when a failure occurs in the test
  		<ul>
  			<li>Defaults to true</li>
	 	</ul>
	</li>
  	<li><code>setScreenshotTaker()</code>: Set a custom screenshot taker
  		<ul>
  			<li>By default this is not set to avoid capturing screen shots when not appropriate</li>
  			<li>The project includes <code>RobotScreenshotTaker</code>code which will capture the full visible screen<br/>
  			    As an alternative, custom screenshots can be captured using the `ScreenshotTaker` interface. For example, when using frameworks
  			    such as Selenium, a custom screenshot taker can capture an image of the entire web page, even if the test is running in the
  			    background.  See the demo application for an example of a custom <code>SeleniumScreenshotTaker</code>.
  			</li>
	 	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><code>removeScreenshotTaker()</code>:Removes the screenshot taker so no further screenshots will be taken
		<ul>
  			<li>If you are mixing GUI and non GUI actions in your storyboard you may want to remove the screenshot taker to prevent further screenshots being 
  			    taken for the current example to keep the cards in a logical order.  The need for this is dependent on the setting of <code>setTakeScreenshotOnExampleCompletion()</code></li>
	 	</ul>
	</li>
  	<li><code>setTakeScreenshotOnExampleCompletion()</code>:  When an example completes a screenshot of the current page will be automatically added to the storyboard - as long as 
	 the screenshot taker has been set. If not using the example command then final screenshots must be added manually.
  		<ul>
  			<li>Defaults to true</li>
	 	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><code>setSkipFinalScreenshotForCurrentExample()</code>:  If configured to take final screenshot for example, this will override that behvaiour for the current example only.
  	</li>
	<li><code>setAcceptCards()</code>: Prevent cards and containers from being added to the the storyboard. This is useful in situations where might be repeating an action 
	  several times and only want to record the first pass through, or performing cleanup steps and don't want the actions recorded.
	 	<ul>
	 		<li>Setting this to false will disable prevent cards and containers being added until either it is set to true, or the current example or specification completes</li>
  			<li>Defaults to true</li>
	 	</ul>
	 </li>
	 <li><code>setTitle()</code>: set a custom title for the storyboard</li>
  </ul>
