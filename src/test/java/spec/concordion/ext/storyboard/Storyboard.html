	<h1>Storyboard Extension</h1>
	
	<p>The Storyboard extension provides the capability to embed a series of 'cards' containing screenshots or data (text, xml, or html) in a panel at 
	the bottom of the specification.</p>
	
	<p>This information is captured at runtime to present actions that have been performed on the system under test.  These can
	be used both as an aid to understanding what the test actually did, and as a debugging tool when something goes wrong.</p>
	
	<p>The name comes from a movie development technique where a panel of pictures or other movie clips, laid out in the sequence that they will
	be shown in the movie.  In general, storyboards are a series of photos or drawings that outline the sequence of scenes and major changes in
	the movie.</p>
